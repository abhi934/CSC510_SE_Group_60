## Introduction

This report reflects on our experiences and challenges as graduate students undertaking Software Engineering Project 1. The project we embarked on involved the evaluation and execution of an existing project titled 'Slash,' developed by previous-year students. 'Slash' aimed to provide a publicly accessible web API framework for retrieving the best deals from renowned e-commerce websites. While the project's potential was evident, it was not without its share of challenges. In this reflective analysis, we will delve deeper into the challenges we encountered, elaborate on strategies for mitigating these challenges in future projects, and underscore our commitment to implementing best practices.

## Challenges in Software Engineering Project 1

### Development Environment Setup

The initial hurdle in Software Engineering Project 1 was the setup of the development environment. This process demanded meticulous alignment of our local systems with the project's specific requirements. The version compatibility issues and environment configuration complexities were particularly daunting. Ensuring that the local development environment mirrored the project's prerequisites was not just time-consuming but often required troubleshooting and adjustments.

### Understanding the Existing Codebase

The second major challenge revolved around comprehending the existing codebase. Software engineering projects often involve contributions from multiple developers, each with their coding styles and approaches. Unfortunately, in the case of 'Slash,' the absence of comprehensive comments and documentation left us struggling with the project's architecture and functionality. Understanding the intricacies of the codebase felt like solving a complex puzzle without all the pieces.

### Ambiguities and Missing Features

While the project's goals were well-articulated, there were ambiguities and missing features. 'Slash,' in its current form, was envisioned as a tool for students to find the best deals across e-commerce sites. It also hinted at serving data analysts by allowing them to create real-time datasets. However, specific implementations related to these use cases were absent or unclear, leaving us uncertain about whether these functionalities were part of the project or part of its future roadmap.

## Strategies for Future Projects

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**:

   For future projects, we firmly commit to prioritizing the creation of comprehensive documentation from the project's inception. This documentation will include thorough setup instructions, a comprehensive architectural overview, and abundant in-code comments to clarify intricate logic and functions. By adhering to rigorous documentation practices, we aim to not only streamline the onboarding process for future developers but also provide a clear roadmap for project comprehension.

2. **Version Control and Dependency Management**:

   To tackle the setup and compatibility challenges in the environment, we will need to establish precise version control and dependency management practices. Tools such as virtual environments, Docker containers, or package managers will play a pivotal role in clearly defining dependencies and facilitating environment replication with ease. Ensuring that every team member is on the same page regarding versions and dependencies is essential to avoid time-consuming compatibility issues.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:

   To proactively detect and rectify compatibility issues, we are committed to embracing continuous integration (CI) practices in future projects. By instituting automated testing procedures and robust CI pipelines, we can systematically identify and address compatibility challenges throughout the development process. This proactive approach will lead to a more stable codebase and reduce the burden of troubleshooting during later stages of the project.

4. **Feature Implementation and User-Centric Approach**:

   In future projects, we shall strive to ensure that all promised features and use cases are implemented as intended. If a project mentions specific functionalities, such as data analysis capabilities or mobile app development, we will diligently work to realize these aspects. This includes thorough documentation and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring that the project aligns seamlessly with its stated objectives.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Software Engineering Project 1 served as a valuable learning experience, exposing us to the intricacies of working with existing codebases and configuring development environments. As dedicated graduate students aspiring to excel in the field of software engineering, we have learned invaluable lessons from these challenges.

As we look ahead to Software Engineering Project 2 and subsequent endeavors, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to implementing best practices and the strategies outlined above. By consistently prioritizing robust documentation, rigorous version control, the integration of continuous testing, and fulfilling all project scope requirements, we are determined to enhance our capabilities as Software Engineers. Our goal is to deliver projects that not only meet technical standards but also exceed user expectations, ultimately contributing to the success of every endeavor we undertake.

This reflective analysis and the strategies outlined herein will serve as a guide for our future projects, ensuring that we navigate challenges effectively and deliver high-quality software solutions.
